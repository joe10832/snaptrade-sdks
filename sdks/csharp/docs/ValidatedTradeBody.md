Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**WaitToConfirm** | **bool?** | Optional, defaults to true. Determines if a wait is performed to check on order status. If false, latency will be reduced but orders returned will be more likely to be of status &#x60;PENDING&#x60; as we will not wait to check on the status before responding to the request. | [optional]
